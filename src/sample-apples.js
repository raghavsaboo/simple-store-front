Juicy, tangy, tart McIntosh has a tender, white flesh. It is best used for snacking and applesauce, but some people enjoy its tart flavor in pies as well. This apple is typically available from September through May. Cook’s hints: McIntosh cooks down easily; if pie making, cut slices thick or add a thickener.",
